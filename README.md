# eye-controlled-virtual-keyboard
The “Gaze controlled keyboard” is a project where we can control the keyboard through our
eyes. The ultimate goal of this project is to write without using the hands. The idea is to create
the virtual keyboard which could be controlled by our gaze without using the hands. Such
applications are really important for people who completely lost the control of their limbs.
Eye gaze technology is one of the most significant techniques of modern science and can be used
in many areas like security, typing, information tracking etc. It involves building a system that
capture video directly from PC camera and detects human face, eyes.
The project consists of two major tasks:
1.Eye Detection: Detection of eyes, their movements and most important their blinking.
2.Virtual Keyboard: A keyboard on the screen where we are going to select the letters by
just using our eyes.
To detect face accurately we are going to use an approach that involves the 68 points of face
which is specific and must exist in every face as-the eye area, top of the chin, eyebrow, nose,
outside edge of face etc.
It also detect eye gaze as left, right to select keyboard portion and eye blinking to select the
desired key from the virtual keyboard on the board.
